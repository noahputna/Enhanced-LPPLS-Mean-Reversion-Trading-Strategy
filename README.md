## Overview
This project investigates whether the inclusion of bubble prediction signals using the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model can enhance the performance of short-term mean reversion trading strategies. We evaluate the strategy's effectiveness across different market conditions by backtesting across two distinct periods: 2005-2010 and 2016-2021.

## Objectives
- Evaluate short-term mean reversion strategies on US equities.
- Identify the weaknesses in reversal-based approaches during bull markets.
- Incorporate LPPLS-based bubble diagnostics to dynamically adjust strategy behaviour.
- Test multiple strategy variants with and without LPPLS filtering.
